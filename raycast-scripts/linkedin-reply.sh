Hello $1,
thanks for reaching out!

Since I receive a lot of messages like these, I'm forced to strictly filter out noise over actual interesting offers.
That's why I'm kindly asking you to provide the following information.
- Name of the company
- Salary expectation
- Link to job posting (if available)

Best,
Michael
